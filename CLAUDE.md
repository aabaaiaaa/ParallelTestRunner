## Project Overview

**Parallel Test Runner** — a .NET dotnet tool that runs test suites faster by splitting them across multiple isolated `dotnet test` processes running in parallel, with configurable in-process parallelism (`--workers`, default 4) within each process. Discovers tests via `dotnet vstest --ListFullyQualifiedTests`, batches them respecting a 7000-character filter string limit, and supports MSTest, xUnit, and NUnit. Designed for CI pipelines with smart retry orchestration, hang detection, and TeamCity `##teamcity` service message forwarding.

## Architecture

The execution pipeline flows: **CLI parsing → Test discovery → Batching → Parallel execution → Smart retry orchestration → Result collation**.

- **Discovery**: Two-step process: first runs `dotnet test --list-tests --no-build` to resolve the test assembly DLL path from the `"Test run for <path>.dll"` output line, then runs `dotnet vstest <dll> --ListFullyQualifiedTests` to extract fully-qualified test names into a temp file. FQNs naturally deduplicate parameterised test variants (the FQN is the base method name, and `FullyQualifiedName=` matches all variants). **Skippable via `--test-list`**: when a pipe-delimited string of FQN test names is provided, discovery is bypassed entirely and the supplied names are fed directly into batching. `--test-list` takes priority — if both `--test-list` and `--filter-expression` are provided, `--filter-expression` is ignored with a warning (since it's a discovery-phase filter with nothing to apply to). After execution, the tool validates that at least one test was actually executed; if zero `##ptr` results are reported, it exits with code 2 and an error indicating the FQN names may not match tests in the assembly.
- **Batching**: Chunks tests by batch size, then auto-splits any chunk whose `FullyQualifiedName=...|FullyQualifiedName=...` filter string exceeds `MaxFilterLength` (7000 chars).
- **Execution**: `SemaphoreSlim(maxParallelism)` throttles concurrent `dotnet test` processes. In-process parallelism is controlled by `--workers` (default 4), which sets `MSTest.Parallelize.Workers`, `xUnit.MaxParallelThreads`, and `NUnit.NumberOfTestWorkers` for each process. Use `--workers 1` to force sequential execution within batches for suites with shared-state contention. Each process runs with `-v normal` verbosity to ensure per-test output keeps the idle timeout alive. Console output is quiet — only `##ptr` result lines and `##teamcity` service messages are printed; all other process output is captured internally for retry/hang detection. TRX result files are always generated (auto-created temp directory or `--results-dir` override). Process lifecycle is wrapped in `TaskCompletionSource` for async-friendly waiting. A `ProgressTracker` counts individual test passes/failures from `##ptr` logger output lines and prints a summary after each batch completes.
- **Custom Logger**: `ParallelTestRunner.TestLogger` is a custom VSTest `ITestLoggerWithParameters` that subscribes to `TestResult` events and emits `##ptr[Outcome|FQN=Ns.Class.Method|Name=Display Name]` lines to stdout in real-time. This solves the critical problem where VSTest's human-readable output uses display names (e.g. "Accept a cancellation quote") that differ from the FQNs used for filtering (e.g. `Ns.Features.CancellationFeature.AcceptACancellationQuote`). The logger DLL ships alongside the tool via a project reference and is discovered at runtime using `AppContext.BaseDirectory` as the test adapter path.
- **Retry Orchestration**: `RetryOrchestrator` runs a unified work loop that combines rescue runs, solo hanger testing, and failure retries into each round to maximise parallel slot utilisation. After the initial run, tests are classified into: passed, failed, suspected hangers, and never-ran (tests behind a hanger in a timed-out batch). The loop builds a combined work pool each round — rescue batches (not counted as retries), solo hanger batches (with 3x extended timeout to distinguish slow tests from true hangers), and retry batches — all executed in a single `RunAllAsync` call. Solo hanger tests run concurrently with other work via `Task.WhenAll` using separate options with the extended timeout. Tests that pass with the extended timeout are reported as "slow tests" with a suggestion to increase `--idle-timeout`. Per-test retry counts ensure each test gets up to `--retries` actual retry attempts (rescue runs don't count). With `--auto-retry`, retries continue as long as at least one test recovers per round.
- **Cancellation**: `CancellationTokenSource` propagates Ctrl+C through all layers, killing spawned process trees gracefully.
- **TeamCity**: Auto-detected via `TEAMCITY_VERSION` env var — appends `--logger teamcity` when present. Works alongside the built-in `##ptr` logger.

## Exit Codes

- `0` — all tests passed
- `1` — one or more batch failures
- `2` — infrastructure error (discovery failure, zero tests found)

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `TEAMCITY_VERSION` | Enables TeamCity logger adapter automatically |
| `FAIL_TESTS` | DummyTestProject: triggers deliberate failures for testing |
| `HANG_TEST` | DummyTestProject: triggers a 30-second blocking test for hang detection testing |
| `FAIL_ONCE` | DummyTestProject: triggers a transient failure (fails first run, passes on retry via temp file marker) |
| `FAIL_DISPLAY_NAME_TESTS` | DummyTestProject: triggers failure on tests with custom display names differing from FQNs |

## Conventions

- .NET 9, C#, nullable enabled, implicit usings
- System.CommandLine (v2.0.0-beta5.25306.1) for CLI parsing
- `InternalsVisibleTo` exposes internals to ParallelTestRunner.Tests
- MSTest 3.x for all tests, including `[DataRow]` parameterised tests and `[TestMethod("display name")]` for custom display names
- All `dotnet test` invocations pass `--no-build`, `-v normal`, `--test-adapter-path`, `--logger ParallelTestRunner`, and `--logger trx` — a separate build step is required
- The custom `ParallelTestRunner.TestLogger` is a project reference, so its DLL ships alongside the tool when packed
- DummyTestProject has `[assembly: Parallelize(Workers = 4)]` to verify the tool's `--workers` override works
- DummyTestProject includes tests with `[TestMethod("...")]` display names to verify FQN-vs-display-name divergence handling
- Integration tests auto-locate solution root by searching upward for `ParallelTestRunner.sln`
